## [Gemma Turon](/speaker/gemma-turon/) 

[Ersilia](https://www.ersilia.io/) – [[💻](https://github.com/GemmaTuron) [👔](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemma-turon/)]

Trained as a molecular biologist, Gemma completed a PhD in colorectal cancer and stem cells at IRB Barcelona in 2019, before taking a one-year break to focus on working and volunteering in the third sector. This shifted her scientific interest to global health and neglected diseases, and the existing barriers to tackle some of the most urgent health issues in developing countries. With Ersilia, she aims to explore new ways of community building and engagement in the scientific arena, at the intersection between academia, biotech start-ups and NPOs.

## [Mike Walmsley](/speaker/mike-walmsley/)

Jesper Dramsch works at the intersection of machine learning and physical, real-world data. Currently, they're working as a scientist for machine learning in numerical weather prediction at the coordinated organisation ECMWF.

Before, Jesper has worked on applied exploratory machine learning problems, e.g. satellites and Lidar imaging on trains, and defended a PhD in machine learning for geoscience. During the PhD, Jesper wrote multiple publications and often presented at workshops and conferences, eventually holding keynote presentations on the future of machine learning.

Moreover, they worked as consultant machine learning and Python educator in international companies and the UK government. Their courses on Skillshare have been watched over 30 days by over 4500 students. Additionally, they create educational notebooks on Kaggle, reaching rank 81 worldwide. Recently, Jesper was invited into the Youtube Partner programme.
