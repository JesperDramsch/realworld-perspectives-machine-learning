This talk will focus on the implementation of ML models to actual experimental pipelines. We will review strategies for sharing pre-trained models that can be readily adopted by non-expert users, and thow to bridge the gap between dry-lab and wet-lab researchers, with case studies in the field of biomedicine. The interactive tutorial will exploit one of such pretrained open source model hub repositories, the Ersilia Model Hub.


Additionally, here are some papers for further reading for the interested:
