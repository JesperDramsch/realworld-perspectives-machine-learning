<p>This talk will focus on the implementation of ML models to actual experimental pipelines. We will review strategies for sharing pre-trained models that can be readily adopted by non-expert users, and thow to bridge the gap between dry-lab and wet-lab researchers, with case studies in the field of biomedicine. The interactive tutorial will exploit one of such pretrained open source model hub repositories, the Ersilia Model Hub.</p>
<p>Additionally, here are some papers for further reading for the interested:</p>
