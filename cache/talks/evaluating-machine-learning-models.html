<p>In this talk, we will introduce the main features of a <strong>Machine Learning (ML) Experiment</strong>. In the first part, we will first dive into understanding the benefits and pitfalls of common evaluation metrics (e.g. accuracy VS F1 score), whilst the second part will be mainly focused on designing reproducible and (statistically) robust evaluation pipelines. </p>
<p>The main lessons learnt and takeaway messages from the talk will be showcased in an interactive tutorial, with applications in biomedicine.</p>
